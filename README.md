## ðŸš— Vehicle Density and Helmet Detection System (YOLOv9)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
A YOLOv9-based traffic density and helmet compliance detection system. It can process static and real-time video, count vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks), and detect motorcyclists without helmets with an alarm notification. The model was trained on Google Colab with dataset augmentation through Roboflow, and the detection results can be saved as video output.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- YOLOv9 for object detection
- Google Colab for model training
- Roboflow for dataset augmentation and management
- OpenCV for video processing
- NumPy for data manipulation
- Windows API (winsound) for beep alarms
- Python as the primary programming language

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Realtime Detection: Supports input from webcams/CCTV cameras.
- Video Processing: Can process static video files.
- Vehicle Counting: Counts the number of vehicles based on their class.
- Helmet Detection: Distinguishes between helmeted and unhelmeted drivers.
- Alert System: Beeps when a helmetless driver is detected.
- Output Recording: Automatically saves detected video.

### ðŸ“ˆ Train Result

- Confusion Matrix : shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class.

- F1-Confidence Curve: This graph shows the relationship between the F1-score value and the confidence threshold used by the model.

```
### 5. Run The Project
```bash
python App.py
```
### ðŸŽ¥ Input and Output
- Input : Video file (video_path = "video/video.mp4")
- For Real-time input use cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) 
- Output : Processed video saved as output_video.mp4
- Visualization : Displays the tracking results with bounding boxes and counts
